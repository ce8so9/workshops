# CTF Trainning

Are you interested in CTF Trainning? Below you will find resources to various different ctf trainning materials. But first a brief explanation as to the different categories.

Pwn:        This is where you have to write exploits to hack vulnerable code.

Rev:        This is where you are handed code, and have to figure out how it works,

Crypto:     This deals with the process of figuring out how to decrypt encrypted data.

Forensics:  Someone hid a flag somewhere, you have to find it (Steganography, PCAP, searching through C drives)

Web:        This is exploitation dealing with websites.

In addition to those, I would recogmend just going though the ctf github repos for the previous years, which contain a lot of previously used ctf challenges:
